# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

npm run dev
# Or
yarn dev
```

After running the server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying the `pages/index.js` file. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

You can access [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). The endpoint can be modified in `pages/api/hello.js`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`, treating files in this directory as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
